# 008_regular_expressions

The purpose of this project is show my skills using regular expressions. For this reason, first, I follow a "Regular Expressions" course in Platzi and for complement this, I implement a Web Form using regular expressions, HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.
I use a FalconMaster Design in his Youtube's Channel for this purpose.
Also the course has some boundaries like using regular expressions with some programming languages (Java, Python or Perl). I attach a Python example on resources.

The objectives of this course and project are the following:

1. Finding real-life applications of regular expressions
2. Using REGEXps in various programming languages
3. Using characters, operators, and constructs to define regular expressions
4. Understanding what regular expressions are and what they are used for
